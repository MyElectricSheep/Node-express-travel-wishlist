![The Travel WishList](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MyElectricSheep/node-express-travel-wishlist/main/travel.jpg)

For this exercise we will build a simple application where we will store a list of countries you wish to go to!

You should use an `array of objects` to store your countries in the country list.  

A country object should have the following shape:
```js
{
	id: 1,
	name: ‚ÄúBhutan‚Äù,
	alpha2Code: ‚ÄúBT‚Äù,
	alpha3Code: ‚ÄúBTN‚Äù
}
```

`ISO Alpha 2` and `ISO Alpha 3` codes [can be found here](https://www.iban.com/country-codes). They are standard codes assigned to identify a country.  

Your application should have the following routes:  

_Note: bonuses are optional. You should only try them out if you can finish the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù routes :)_  

1. `GET` `/api/countries` - this should respond with a list of countries in your list. You should start off with 5 countries. 
- BONUS: add support for a query string that would return all countries sorted alphabetically; something like `?sort=true` (_hint_: true will be passed as ‚Äútrue‚Äù - string type - in your query string)
---
2. `POST` `/api/countries` - this route should accept JSON data and add the new country received to the list of countries (eg: add an object inside the countries array).  
- BONUS: Do not accept the country if it already exists in the list; check both the alpha 2 code and the alpha 3 code for a match.
- BONUS 2: Validate the data you receive (You can use [express-validator](https://express-validator.github.io/docs/), which is based on [validator.js](https://github.com/validatorjs/validator.js) before adding it !  
---
3. `GET` `/api/countries/:code` - this route should return a single country, based on the code provided. You should accept **both** an alpha 2 OR an alpha 3 code.  
- BONUS: handle the situation where the country does not exist in your list  
---
4. `PUT` `/api/countries/:code` - this route should accept edits to an existing country in the list (eg: edit an object inside the countries array).
- BONUS: Check if the country is in your list before allowing edition. 	
- BONUS 2: Validate the data you receive before updating the country. Can you make it so that you use the same validation logic that for the POST route, without duplicating your code?
---
5. `DELETE` `/api/countries/:code` - this route should allow you to delete a specific country from the list (eg: remove an object from the array)
- BONUS: you‚Äôve changed your mind; what if you segmented your countries into two categories? One that would be ‚Äúalready visited‚Äù and the other which would be ‚Äúto visit‚Äù?
- In that case hitting the delete endpoint would just change that specific flag in your country object instead of completely removing it from the array.
- To achieve this properly; you will also need to: 
-- Edit your country objects to add a **visited** boolean flag
-- Update your validation logic to take this into account for the POST and PUT routes
-- Edit the get all countries routes so that you can pass a **visited=true** query string, on top of the sorting one, to filter and return countries by their status
---
6. `Add routing` - Move all your request handlers to a specific router. For example, all requests made to `/api/countries` should be processed into a dedicated router like `wishlistRouter.js`

### üåü SUPER EXTRA BONUS STEP üåü  

Do only if you have completed all previous steps + associated bonuses  

7. `Add a views engine` - use a templating engine (like [EJS](https://ejs.co/) - **Embedded JavaScript templates**) to add views to your application. A template engine ([hint](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-template-engines.html)) enables you to use static template files in your application. At runtime, the template engine replaces variables in a template file with actual values, and transforms the template into an HTML file sent to the client! 

Try and follow [the official documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs) and [this guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-ejs-to-template-your-node-application) to achieve this step!
- Display the list of countries in the wishlist
- Add a form to be able to add a new country in the list
